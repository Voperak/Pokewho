# Pokewho
A simple website to look up Pokemon and get some basic information about them such as the starting stats, attacks, health, weight, etc. Works on mobile, but will have weird positioning/scaling due to zoom/rotatation/mobile view. There is also the issue with the search bar being able to overlap the infomation containers. Will hopefully be fixed in future updates. This is my first project working with CSS/HTML/JS so do not expect too much quality.

## A live version of the site can be found [here](https://voperak.github.io/Pokewho/src/)
