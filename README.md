# Pokewho
A simple website to look up Pokemon and get some basic information about them such as the starting stats, attacks, health, weight, etc. Works on mobile, but will have weird positioning/scaling due to zoom/rotatation/mobile view.

## A live version of the site can be found [here](https://voperak.github.io/Pokewho/src/)
